*How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure my code, program or software is functional and secure by testing them frequently and accurately. If there are errors founds they need to be fixed promptly to avoid large amounts of rework later. Quality and security should always be prioritized and testing these extraneously can ensure everything is running properly. Using automated tools in CI/CD pipelines can streamline this process. 

*How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The first step is to talk to the user and ask questions about what they hope to accomplish with the program. Map out the user needs to keep track of what the requirements are and analyze these requirements to create detailed specifications to accomplish the tasks. 

*How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by looking at the requirements and creating a pseudocode to keep me on track and try to make sure I don't miss anything. I try to make my code as efficient as possible and test frequently to check for mistakes. I try to remove bias and remind myself that I will make mistakes and to not overlook them because my pride may get in the way. Making a functional, quality driven, secure program that meets the users needs should always be the goal.
